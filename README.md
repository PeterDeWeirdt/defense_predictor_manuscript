# DefensePredictor: A Machine Learning Model to Discover Novel Prokaryotic Immune Systems

Code used to build DefensePredictor, a machine-learning model that leverages embeddings from a protein language model, [ESM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm), to classify proteins as anti-phage defensive.
